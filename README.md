# asset-allocation-personal-track-record

**Background**

Since starting my career in portfolio management in 2020, I have believed that most industry participants should maintain a transparent track record of their key investment convictions over time. While standalone portfolio managers naturally build such a record through the funds they run, this is less straightforward for professionals managing money collectively or operating outside a PM role.

In those cases, systematically tracking one’s own investment ideas and process can be extremely valuable. It helps identify biases and accelerate learning, while also providing future employers or investors with a clear view of how one’s market views have evolved over time.

**Repository purpose**

This repository documents my quarterly asset allocation decisions. Each allocation is published prior to the start of the relevant quarter and remains unchanged thereafter. Portfolio performance is added ex post to objectively assess the robustness and consistency of the investment process.

As of early 2026, only the Momentum/Contrarian portfolio is being tracked. Additional strategies may be introduced in the future. To mitigate survivorship bias, any new process must be monitored for a minimum of three years, with this repository serving as a permanent and transparent record.
